1. Write a Query to provide the Production details in Canada with the Total cost.

SELECT p.Name, p.Price, s.Quantity, p.Price * s.Quantity AS TotalCost

FROM Product p

JOIN Sales s ON p.ID = s.ProductId

WHERE s.Country = 'Canada';


2. Which Product sold the most items

SELECT Name, SUM(Quantity) AS Total

FROM Product

JOIN Sales

ON Product.ID = Sales.ProductId

GROUP BY Name

ORDER BY Total DESC;

4. Code Recognition for WORDLE
- No reprating letters
- The answer is a Noun or a Verb
- The words are in the 1st and 4th position
- A sign or measurement of something

August 15th is INDEX, August 16th word will likely end in EX - ANNEX, LATEX, CODEX
I saw a code on Github which tries to find the word for the day, however, sample words must be entered to try guessing the word for the day.
